# BCMLtoSBMLconverter
A set of Python scripts to convert BCML format to SBML.

Step 1 : Read a BCML file and create an SBML, using bcml_to_sbml.py
Example of a command line :
$ python bcml_to_sbml.py ../DC-ATLAS/BCML/TLR9.xml

Step 2 : Open newly created files in CellDesigner
Open newly created files in CellDesigner and save them (under a different name). CellDesigner will add its extended content to the file. This extended content can then be adjusted in the next step to take advantage of all CellDesigner functionalities and visual representations.

Step 3 : Improve XML files generated by CellDesigner after a BCML to SBML conversion, using improve_cd_file.py
$ python improve_cd_file.py ./DC-SIGN_cd.xml

Step 4 : Manual adjustments
- Check that modifications correspond to the 'id' of each species. Some macromolecules don't list all modifications inside the notes. Sometimes, it's only in names. ex: Stat1_p_1 in DC-Sign (s103).
- Move degradation elements inside compartments
- Move compartments inside each other
- Species without connections belong to complexes and should be moved inside them. More generally, add species forming Complexes inside them.
- Visually re-organise maps.
- PMID to put in MIRIAM.
